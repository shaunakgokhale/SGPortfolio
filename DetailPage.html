                        <p>In the June of 2018, I was presented with an opportunity to design product interfaces for an industrial smart-glasses called RealWear. Itâ€™s a head mounted display designed to aid Industrial workers during critical steps. I had given the responsibility to design an experience for Quality check & Training procedures. The hardware is controlled by voice recognition. The users have to speak commands in order to interact.</p>

                        <h2>Empathise</h2>
                        <p>I travelled to the factory where the workers use the basic product, without a much designed app. Their primary concerns were a glaring to their eyes and irregular commands which were hard to remember. After getting to know how they use this wearable, I started paper prototyping.</p>
